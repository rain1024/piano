## Level 1: Melody

**Concept:** Play a simple melody line with the right hand only.

**Skills developed:**
- Single-note melody reading
- Basic rhythm and timing
- Finger positioning and movement

**Mary Had a Little Lamb - Level 1:**

| E D C D | E E E E | D D E D | C4 :|
```

## Level 2: One-Finger Bassline

**Concept:** Add a simple bass accompaniment using the left hand, playing only root notes of each chord.

**Skills developed:**
- Hand coordination (right hand melody + left hand bass)
- Understanding of chord roots
- Steady rhythmic foundation
- Two-hand independence

**Technique notes:**
- Left hand plays only root notes of each chord
- Can use different rhythm patterns (whole notes, half notes, or quarter notes)
- Bass notes follow the harmonic progression
- Creates a clean, simple accompaniment with space

**Mary Had a Little Lamb - Level 2 (One-Finger Bass):**
```abc
X:2
T:Mary Had a Little Lamb - Level 2 (One-Finger Bassline)
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
V:1 clef=treble name="Right Hand"
|: E D C D | E E E2 | D D D2 | E G G2 |
| E D C D | E E E E | D D E D | C4 :|
V:2 clef=bass name="Left Hand"
|: C,4 | C,4 | G,4 | C,4 |
| C,4 | C,4 | G,4 | C,4 :|
```

**Variation - Alternating Bass Pattern:**

|: C, z C, z | C, z C,2 | G, z G,2 | C, z C,2 |
| C, z C, z | C, z C, z | G, z G, z | C,4 :|
```

**Practice tips:**
- Practice hands separately first, then combine
- Keep the left hand steady and consistent
- Experiment with different rhythmic patterns
- Common in stride piano and jazz styles

## Level 3: Two-Finger Bassline (Root + Fifth)

**Concept:** Enhance the bass by playing root note and fifth as intervals, creating a fuller harmonic foundation.

**Skills developed:**
- Playing intervals with left hand
- Understanding of chord roots and fifths
- Richer harmonic awareness
- Smooth voice leading between chords

**Technique notes:**
- Left hand plays root note and fifth simultaneously (e.g., C + G)
- Creates a fuller, richer bass sound compared to single notes
- Intervals strengthen the harmonic foundation
- Focus on smooth transitions between chords

**Mary Had a Little Lamb - Level 3 (Two-Finger Bass):**
```abc
X:3
T:Mary Had a Little Lamb - Level 3 (Two-Finger Bassline)
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
V:1 clef=treble name="Right Hand"
|: E D C D | E E E2 | D D D2 | E G G2 |
| E D C D | E E E E | D D E D | C4 :|
V:2 clef=bass name="Left Hand"
|: [C,G,]4 | [C,G,]4 | [G,,D,]4 | [C,G,]4 |
| [C,G,]4 | [C,G,]4 | [G,,D,]4 | [C,G,]4 :|
```

**Practice tips:**
- Master Level 2 (one-finger bass) before progressing to this level
- Practice the interval shapes separately to build muscle memory
- Listen for the fuller, richer sound compared to single bass notes
- Maintain steady rhythm while playing intervals

---

## Level 4: Chords

**Concept:** Play full chords with the left hand instead of just bass notes or intervals.

**Skills developed:**
- Playing three-note chords (triads)
- Understanding chord construction (root, third, fifth)
- Left hand chord voicings
- Richer harmonic accompaniment
- Chord rhythm patterns

**Technique notes:**
- Left hand plays complete triads (three notes)
- C major chord: C + E + G
- G major chord: G + B + D
- Chords typically played on strong beats
- Can use whole notes, half notes, or rhythmic patterns

**Mary Had a Little Lamb - Level 4 (Chords):**
```abc
X:4
T:Mary Had a Little Lamb - Level 4 (Chords)
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
V:1 clef=treble name="Right Hand"
| E D C D | E E E2 | D D D2 | E G G2 |
| E D C D | E E E E | D D E D | C4 |]
V:2 clef=bass name="Left Hand"
| [C,E,G,]4 | [C,E,G,]4 | [G,,B,,D,]4 | [C,E,G,]4 |
| [C,E,G,]4 | [C,E,G,]4 | [G,,B,,D,]4 | [C,E,G,]4 |]
```

**Variation - Rhythmic Chord Pattern:**
```abc
X:4-alt
T:Mary Had a Little Lamb - Level 4 (Rhythmic Chords)
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
V:1 clef=treble name="Right Hand"
| E D C D | E E E2 | D D D2 | E G G2 |
| E D C D | E E E E | D D E D | C4 |]
V:2 clef=bass name="Left Hand"
| [C,E,G,] z [C,E,G,] z | [C,E,G,] z [C,E,G,]2 | [G,,B,,D,] z [G,,B,,D,]2 | [C,E,G,] z [C,E,G,]2 |
| [C,E,G,] z [C,E,G,] z | [C,E,G,] z [C,E,G,] z | [G,,B,,D,] z [G,,B,,D,] z | [C,E,G,]4 |]
```

**Practice tips:**
- Start by practicing chord shapes without the melody
- Ensure all three notes sound clearly and evenly
- Master Level 3 before attempting full chords
- Listen for the richer, fuller harmonic sound
- Common chord voicings: keep chords in the same register for smooth transitions
